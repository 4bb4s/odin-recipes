    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup coca</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups boiling water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped nuts</li>
        <li>1/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) and grease a 9x13-inch  baking dish.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Stir to mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Combine boiling water and butter in a bowl, and stir until the butter is melted. Allow about 5 minutes for the mixture to cool. While stirring briskly, slowly add eggs. When the egg and butter mixture is well blended, stir in vanilla.</li>
        <li>Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture and beat about 2 minutes. Stir in nuts, if using.</li>
        <li>Pour batter into the prepared pan, and bake in the center of the preheated oven until a wooden pick inserted in the middle of the cake comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cool completely on a wire rack, about 15 minutes. When cool, place powdered sugar in a mesh sieve, or a sifter, and dust the cake with powdered sugar, if desired. Cut into squares and serve.</li>
    </ol>
